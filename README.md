##Violence Detection using Machine Learning

Detecting the violence using ML and send notification to the nearest police through APP

<h1>#This System is a prototype system detects the violence activity and sends notification through app along with the location of the event.</h1>

Hawkeye is a real time survillance app that aims to improve the response time of the police force in case of any violence. We have created a machine learning module that uses temporal convolution network to extract features from a CCTV camera. If any violence activity detected, it automatically detects it and send notification to the hawkeye user along with the saved clip of violence with location and camera id.

<h2>#Objective:</h2>

Our solution is to achieve the detection of abnormal activities using video metadata and Machine learning to build a system for real-time alerts, triggering real-time notifications to action when certain objects Or behaviours are detected or when anomalous activity Occurs. In the case of CCTV networks, machine learning-based video content analysis software learns to identify, extract, classify and index objects in video to empower end users to make video data searchable, actionable and quantifiable.
